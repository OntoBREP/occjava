occjava-swig is a Java wrapper for a small subset of Opencascade
libraries based on swig (www.swig.org).

This library is needed to run the CAD module of jCAE. It should be
installed like this :
- install swig
- export CASROOT=<Opencascade/ros>
- when compiling from SVN instead of tarballs, run ./autogen.sh
- ./configure
- make
- make install
- ant

Mixing libstdc++5 and libstdc++6
--------------------------------
Starting from version 0.14.1+r1221 (2007-05-10), using the same g++ version for
OpenCASCADE and occjava is required. This is due to the addition of STL iostream
binding. The official binaries of OpenCASCADE 6.2 are built with g++-3.3. If
you get this compilation warning:
ld: warning: libstdc++.so.5, needed by XXXXXX, may conflict with libstdc++.so.6
occjava will crash as soon as you will use the iostream binding.

Note
----
The wrapper may not compile properly with -O2. -fno-strict-aliasing
is required with -O2. See:

How to add class and methods (draft)
----------------------------
- Find the src/*.i file you want to modify or add a new one (grep ;) )
- Copy method/class definition from Opencascade header
- For Geom_Geometry and Geom2d_Geometry: Change Handle(aType) to Handle_aType
