occjava-swig is a Java wrapper for a small subset of Opencascade libraries based on swig (www.swig.org).

This library is needed to run the CAD module of jCAE. It should be installed like this :
- install swig
- export CASROOT=<Opencascade/ros>
- ./configure CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/lib/j2sdk1.5-sun/include/ -I/usr/lib/j2sdk1.5-sun/include/linux"
- make
- make install
- ant

How to add class and methods (draft)
----------------------------
- Find the src/*.i file you want to modify or add a new one.
- Copy method/class definition from Opencascade header
- Change Handle(aType) by aType *
